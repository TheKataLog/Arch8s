# C4 Models
We are using C4 Models to build our models.   
https://c4model.com/ 

> The C4 model is an easy to learn, developer friendly approach to software architecture diagramming.

## Level 1. System Context
> Level 1: A System Context diagram provides a starting point, showing how the software system in scope fits into the world around it.

## Level 2. Container
> Level 2: A Container diagram zooms into the software system in scope, showing the high-level technical building blocks.

## Level 3. Component
> Level 3: A Component diagram zooms into an individual container, showing the components inside it.

## Level 4. Code (skipped)
> Level 4: A code (e.g. UML class) diagram can be used to zoom into an individual component, showing how that component is implemented.
