# 017 Community Services - Disciple

Date: 2022-06-22

## Status

Confirmed

## Context

The community's network effect is hugely dependent on the amount and quality of content that the community offers to its members. 
Content will always be engaging.

- Forum - A forum is a type of interaction that focuses on long-living discussions 
- Chat - A chat is a real-time stream of short messages

We'd like to use a system that helps us get the full picture of correlated business events.

## Alternatives

#### Amity

https://www.amity.co/

Amity Social Cloud, provide platform with social features:
Feeds(Forum) and Chat to Stories and Live Streaming.

#### Getsocial

https://docs.getsocial.im/

The only all-in-one acquisition and engagement platform for mobile apps. Boost user acquisition with referral marketing
& drive engagement with chat, communities, marketing automation


#### Disciple
https://www.disciplemedia.com/pricing/

Disciple is a white-label community app,  it gives its users a fully-branded platform that lets them build and charge for communities around the things they care about.

Disciple gives you lots of options to build a community, and you can create the type of solid content that brings your users together. You can add multimedia posts and live stream (but only on the app). You can also build courses for the app, and both the website and the app give you options for emailing and notifying members about content as well as an interactive activity feed so they can see whatâ€™s happening in your community.

If you pay for the premium tier and get the app, you are assigned a customer success manager and can add up to 500 members included in your plan (the web app is limited to 100 without paying extra).


## Decision

We are going to use **Disciple** as it provides most futures required by Spotlight platform and is the cheapest option.


## Consequences

We will have to spend $38 for 500 active users per month and the price might increase in the future. 
We think it unlikely it will be a significant increase. Reduced burden on maintenance due to Disciple being a managed service.
