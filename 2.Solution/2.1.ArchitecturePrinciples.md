# Architecture Principles

The following are high-level architecture principles that we shall apply to the architecture of Spotlight App:

## General Architecture


| Principle                         | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Implications                                                                                                        |

| Modular monolyth                  | *modularity* is the practice of encapsulating portions of your application into self-contained services that can be individually designed, developed, tested, and deployed with little or no dependency on other components or services in the application.                                                                                                                                                                              | Components/services can be tested/deployed with minimal business disruption. Improved availability and reliability. |
| Pattern based architecture        | Industry well recognised/proven pattern based architectures will improve re-usability.<br />It is necessary to understand both the structural and communication patterns that can be used for designing the product line software architecture. Structural patterns address the overall structure of the software architecture. Communication patterns address the ways in which distributed components can communicate with each other. | Less effort to build and maintain systems                                                                           |
| Compliant with law and regulation | All solutions must be law-abiding and compile with rules and guidance from regulatory bodies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Rules of the road, just follow them!                                                                                |

| Data is valuable asset | In current era data collected/managed across systems in organisation can be harvested to maximise business benefit. | Business can evolve, adapt based on insights from the data. It covers current and historical data for all objects like customer, product, sales, staff, tickets and feedback. |
| Access to the data     | system components, humans require access to the data time-to-time.                                                  | Data democratisation using appropriate governance and controls will reduce the risk of data loss or need for data replication.                                                |

## Integration


| Principle                                        | Rationale                               | Implications                                                                       |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inter and intra system integration through API's | Services/components need to communicate | Standards based Information exchange across enterprise will benefit organisations. |

## Security


| Principle         | Rationale                                                                                                                              | Implications                                      |

| Secure from Start | Security is not a after thought. Security built into system and process design will provides more security for valuable business data. | Secured and protected organisation in digital era |

## Extend-ability and Maintain-ability


| Principle                     | Rationale                                                                                                                                     | Implications                                |

| System should be extendable   | New functionality will be required to support system evolution.                                                                               | can support changing business needs.        |
| System should be Maintainable | Regular maintenance activities, fixing bugs are essential for any operational system. Will be able to perform change reliably and effectively | Least business disruption during the change |
