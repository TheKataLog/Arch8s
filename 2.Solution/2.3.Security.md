# Security

There are few recommendations we could give regarding security:
- Use Group-based role management, not user-based. It will minimize risks of having users with very custom and tricky permissions
- Regularly review the list of users who has superadmin role permissions
- Bring proper onboarding and offboarding procedure to eliminate risks connected with unauthorized access of ex-employees
- Use 4-eyes principle to review changes
- Use zero-trust model for communication even with internal services, always validate user input
- Onboarding for developers should include OWASP 10 threats modeling session, 12-factor app principles and dependency pinning
- Monitor your system for unusual activities (high amount of traffic, calls to the external systems)
- Bring data processing into isolated perimeter
- Use OAuth to simplify user login procedures. Supplies the authorization workflow for web, desktop applications, and mobile devices. OAuth is a server side web app that uses authorization code and does not interact with user credentials.
