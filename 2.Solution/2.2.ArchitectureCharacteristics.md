# Architecture Characteristics

## Key Architectural Characteristics

We have identified following architectural characteristics, top 3 are marked with *:

* Simplicity *
* Cost *
* Domain partitioning *
* Scalability

### Architecture Capabilities Comparison

The above key characteristics are highlighted below in yellow:

## Architecture Styles Analysis

The above matrix gives us tree candidates for our architecture, which need further analysis:

### Modular monolith

Overall cost and simplicity are the primary strengths of the layered architecture style.
Monolith broken into modules that can be developed independently can deliver many benefits while sidestepping many of the challenges of a microservice architecture, and can be the sweet spot for many organizations.

### Microkernel

<img src="../assets/images/architecture-styles-microkernel.png" alt="Architecture style Microkernel" width="300">

The microkernel architecture style is a relatively simple monolithic architecture consisting of two architecture components: a core system and plug-in components. Application logic is divided between independent plug-in components and the basic core system, providing extensibility, adaptability, and isolation of application features and custom processing logic.

## Conclusion

Both architecture options have trade-offs, but the trade-offs for the Event-Driven architecture are lower overall.
