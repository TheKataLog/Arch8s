# Deployment

We picked AWS ECS service with reserved (for critical workload) and spot instances (for irregular workload).

- ECS will enable us to use Docker as local and production environment
- Reserved instances will save money in a long run, we need to calculate all needed resources in advance;
- Spot instances will save money for CI/CD pipelines and heavy recommended calculations, where short restart due to eviction is not that critical;

One of the key thing while using AWS is to carefully pick instance sizes and monitor costs. We need to define threshold for already spent money notifications.

### Cloud infrastructure

- AWS IAM (x3 instances - production, staging and CI/CD)
- AWS ECS - to serve main monolith workload
- AWS RDS Postgres (burst tX instances for staging, normal rX for production workload)
- AWS S3 - to be a ephemeral mutable disk for docker containers
- AWS System Manager - to keep credentials in its vault
- AWS API Gateway - to serve and proxify requests
- AWS Route53 (x2, for production and staging), to register DNS and MX records
- AWS SES with configured DKIM/DMARC domain, to send transactional emails
- AWS Lambda - to send push notifications, render PDFs
- AWS Eventbridge
- AWS Cloudwatch - to collect logs
- AWS VPC - to isolate critical infrastructure

### External software

- Issue tracker, Jira
- CI/CD platform, Gitlab + private runners on spot instances

### Spotlight Operations

- Forum board, to build a place for community discussions
- Headless CMS to manage content
- Standalone community platform (whitelabel)

### Third-party integrations

- Zoom, to organize videocalls between candidates and mentors, NPOs and community leaders
- Google Calendar/Apple Calendar, to schedule a call
- Sentry, to track user errors
