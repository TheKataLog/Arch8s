# Constraints

> Architectural constraints are limitations that are imposed on the platform to be fully implement

- **Financial** - the solution must be affordable as possible, since it is for use by non-profit organisations with restrained budget.
- **Time** - Project should have the shortest time-to-market (TTM)
- **Geographical** - Our solution is servicing only North America non-profit organization and candidates
- **Language** - To help with diversity _Spotlight_ should support top 3 languages used within USA
- **Legal** - Spotlight is a user-generated-content platform, we need profanity filter and a way to report problematic cases.
- **Web and mobile** support  
- **Team** - small team, developers are freelancers
