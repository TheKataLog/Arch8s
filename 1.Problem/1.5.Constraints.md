# Constraints

> Architectural constraints are limitations that are imposed on the platform to be fully implement

* Our solution is servicing only North America non-profit organization and candidates
* Cost - the solution must be affordable as possible, since it is for use by non-profit organisations with restrained budget.
* Should support on web and mobile 
* Browser support - only most popular 4 browsers:
  - Google Chrome	77.03%
  - Safari	8.87%
  - Mozilla Firefox	7.69%
  - Microsoft Edge	5.83%


# Issues
> Issues are the outstanding questions that have not been resolved. 

[//]: # (Image What areas of the architecture have not been finalized?)
* Project conceptual class/object model haven't been finalized

[//]: # (Image Are there areas of technology that have not been spiked, contain areas of concern, or have known problems?)

[//]: # (Image Are there contractual issues in play?)

[//]: # (Image Has a key resource recently moved to another part of the company?)

[//]: # (Image Is the deadline for delivery overly aggressive?)
