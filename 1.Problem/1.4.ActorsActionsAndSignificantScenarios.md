# Actors, Actions & Significant Scenarios

> The Actors are typically human users, but they can also include other systems or actions that help form the critical scenarios.

The following identifies the significant actors, actions and key scenarios that inform the architecture of the Spotlight Platform system.

## Actors & Actions

The system is split into three different group of actors:
- Community Leaders, 
- Non-profit staff,
- Candidates. 

For security reasons, we've split it into more specific user roles.
