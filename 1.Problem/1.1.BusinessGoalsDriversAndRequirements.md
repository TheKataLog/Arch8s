# Business Goals, Drivers and Requirements

## Background

> The Spotlight App Platform is a sustained effort to amass a coalition of nonprofits to address specific needs within the communities we serve by leveraging a centralized platform as the base of operations to collaborate and make a collective impact.

We want to provide a matching service platform which helps candidates who need help that leads to career
opportunities are trained, facilitated and supported to build confidence and aim to reduce this with the least turnaround time.

## Business Goals

> Business goals are a predetermined target that a business or individual plans to achieve in a set period of time
> 
1. Problem Statement #1: The decentralization and lack of support between nonprofits create gaps in service and overall impact.
2. Problem Statement #2: The lack of visibility of nonprofit groups and offerings creates a barrier to access to the people we aim to serve.

## Business Drivers

> Business drivers are the key inputs and activities that drive the operational and financial results of a business.

For DCC Spotlight, we identified three main business drivers:
- The number of NPOs onboarded on the platform
- The number of candidates who solved their issues with the help of NPOs
- The number of communities which bring partnerships amongst NPOs

### Requirements and Engagement model

#### Functional requirements

> _Functional requirements (FR)_ are product features or functions that developers must implement to enable users to accomplish their tasks. So, itâ€™s important to make them clear both for the development team and the stakeholders. Generally, functional requirements describe system behavior under specific conditions. For

The Platform must establish a way to incentivize engagement:

- sharing of resources
- collaboration, networking
- facilitating introductions, and partnerships

#### Non-functional Requirements

> _Non-functional requirements (NFR)_, not related to the system functionality, rather define how the system should perform.

End Ease of Use (Usability) - Users should be able to fulfill their tasks in the system with ease

Accessability - Properly designed system can be used by people with disabilities

#### Engagement model
